    To get all the solutions of the problem, as they come up. 
    https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver#all_solutions

    The solutions are all unique. But for the child rectangles that have same dimensions, 
    some solution will be repetitive. Because for the algorithm, they are different solutions, 
    but because of same size, they are merely permutations of the similar child rectangles - 
    having other rectangles' positions fixed.

    We want to remove repetitive extra solutions. One way to do this is
        1. Stringify every rectangle coords in a solution
            (1,2)->(2,3) becomes "1,2,2,3"

            # here the rectangles are stored as a string: "1,2,2,3" where x1=1, y1=2, x2=2, y2=3
        
        2. Put all these string coords into a sorted list. This sorting is important. 
            Because the rectangles (1,2)->(2,3) and (3,3)->(4,4) are actually same size (1x1) rectangles. 
            And they can appear in 1st solution as 
            [(1,2)->(2,3)   ,   (3,3)->(4,4)]
            and in the 2nd solution as
            [(3,3)->(4,4)   ,   (1,2)->(2,3)]

            but this sorted list of strings will ensure both solutions are represented as

            [..., "1,2,2,3", "3,3,4,4", ...]

        3. Join the Set of "strings (rectangles)" in to one big string seperated by '-'. For every solution.
            So in resulting big strings (solutions), we will have two similar strings (solutions) 
            that be similar and also contain

            "....1,2,2,3-3,3,4,4-...."

        4. Now add all these "strings (solutions)" into a Set. this adding to the set 
        will remove similar strings. And hence duplicate solutions will be removed.
